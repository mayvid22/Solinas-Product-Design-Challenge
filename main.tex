\section*{Executive Summary}
The primary objective of this project was to conceptualize and design an innovative agitator for household wastewater. The emphasis was on designing a robust and portable shaft for the agitator, with the ultimate goal of creating a solution that is not only efficient but also suitable for deployment in India. This design endeavor is motivated by a broader societal aim â€“ the eradication of manual scavenging. By developing a practical and affordable agitator mechanism, the intention was to contribute to improved wastewater management practices in households across rural India, thereby mitigating the need for manual scavenging and fostering sustainable sanitation solutions.
\vspace{2mm} \\
The design of the shaft focused on creating a retractable and expandable mechanism, allowing for a length to vary from 1 meter to 5 meters. The choice of material for the shaft is stainless steel 304, selected for its inherent strength and resistance to corrosion, particularly crucial when dealing with the corrosive nature of toxic chemicals present in the slurry water. The process involved extensive research, not only in the construction of the shaft but also in developing the impeller and control system. This comprehensive approach aimed to ensure that the agitator could withstand the challenging conditions posed by the toxic slurry water, emphasizing durability, functionality, and resilience in its design.
\vspace{2mm} \\
Consequently, the design of the shaft was meticulously developed to incorporate a remarkable depth capability. Rigorous efforts were invested in fortifying the agitator's structural integrity, subjecting it to a series of tests through simulation software to ensure robustness and portability. Simultaneously, the impeller underwent a meticulous design process, optimizing its shape to achieve optimal performance in the agitation of wastewater. Furthermore, a concerted effort was made to manage the overall weight of the shaft, ensuring that the shaft remained under 30 kilograms for enhanced maneuverability and operational efficiency. Additional measures were implemented to guarantee the system's resilience, with particular emphasis on waterproofing and sparkproofing achieved through the strategic integration of wiper seals and bearings.

\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Wastewater Management Landscape in India}

Wastewater characteristics depend largely on the mass loading rates flowing from the various sources in the collection system. The flow in sanitary sewers is a composite of domestic and industrial wastewater. \\
Industrial wastewater represents the discharges of manufacturing processes, including petrochemical, textile, electroplating, pharmaceutical, and food. It has very variable quality and volume depending on the type of industry producing it. It may be highly biodegradable or not at all and may or may not contain compounds recalcitrant to treatment. 
\vspace{2mm} \\
Domestic wastewater is composed of almost 99.9\% of water along with relatively small concentrations of organic and inorganic solids in dissolved or suspended form. The content mainly consists of organic substances such as synthetic detergents, fats, soaps, lignin, carbohydrates, and proteins. In addition to the organic constituents, domestic wastewater contains a portion of inorganic substances including certain heavy metals like lead, cadmium, mercury arsenic, copper, chromium, and zinc. These toxic elements might be present within their permissible limit as directed by the WHO but still need to be processed. 
\vspace{2mm} \\
The density of household slurry is around $1.4 g/cm^3$ and viscosity is $0.05 Pa-s$. \cite{THOTARADHAKRISHNAN2018235} 
\vspace{2mm} \\
Septic tank cleaning is a crucial maintenance process aimed at removing accumulated solids and floating scum from the tank to ensure its optimal performance. Over time, solid waste settles at the bottom of the tank, forming sludge, while lighter materials like grease and oils float to the top as scum. To initiate the cleaning process, professional technicians use specialized equipment, such as vacuum trucks equipped with powerful pumps. \\

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=12cm]{Graphics/septic tank.png} \\
    Fig 1.1: Structure of a Septic Tank \\
\end{center}

The first step involves locating and accessing the septic tank. Once accessed, the technicians pump out the liquid contents, including the sludge and scum layers. Agitation of the wastewater is then employed to disturb and break up settled solids. This process enhances the removal efficiency during pumping. Mechanical devices, like agitators or high-pressure water jets, can be introduced to the tank to stir and suspend the contents, facilitating their removal. 
\vspace{2mm} \\
After agitation, the loosened contents are thoroughly pumped out, ensuring that the tank is cleaned effectively. Regular septic tank cleaning, typically recommended every 3-5 years, helps prevent clogs, system failures, and environmental contamination, maintaining the longevity and efficiency of the septic system. Most of the agitator technologies used in India are either extremely expensive or are not effective enough. This creates a need for manually scavenging the slurry that is left unagitated at the bottom of septic tanks. 
\vspace{2mm} \\
As per a July 2023 report by the Social Justice Ministry, only 66\% of districts in the country are free of manual scavenging.\cite{manual_scavenging} In many areas, especially in rural and economically disadvantaged regions, there is limited access to or affordability of advanced technologies for wastewater treatment. Manual scavenging may persist due to the absence of mechanized equipment.

\section{Current Technology}
Commencing in the early 1900s, wastewater treatment initiatives were primarily directed toward the elimination of suspended particulate matter, the treatment of biodegradable compounds, and the eradication of microorganisms.
\vspace{2mm} \\
%The primary approach to wastewater disposal in urban centers involves releasing it into surface water bodies, while suburban and rural regions commonly utilize subsurface disposal methods. Regardless of the method, wastewater necessitates purification or treatment to safeguard public health and maintain water quality. The removal of suspended particles and biodegradable organics is imperative to varying degrees. Pathogenic bacteria must be eradicated, and there may be a need to eliminate nitrates and phosphates (plant nutrients) while neutralizing or eliminating industrial wastes and toxic chemicals. \\
Conventional industrial wastewater management processes are listed below.
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=16cm]{Graphics/Processes.png} \\
    Fig 1.2: Wastewater Management Processes \\
\end{center}

After this foundational period, the evolution of treatment processes has been characterized by a concerted effort to preserve the aesthetic integrity of the environment and mitigate the adverse impact on human health. Advanced research endeavors have systematically explored a spectrum of physical, chemical, and biological methodologies, culminating in the synthesis of hybrid approaches that amalgamate two or more distinct processes. This strategic integration serves to augment operational efficiency and amplify recovery rates significantly.
\vspace{2mm} \\
An example of such a contemporary system that practices these evolutionary ideas can be the Solinas HomoSEP. By focusing on the inclusion of robot sterilization, it enhances safety and hygiene by eliminating human entry into manholes, and reducing risks associated with the handling of septic tank contents. The system ensures accurate quantification of homogenized slurry, promoting precision in the treatment process.\cite{homosep}

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=12cm]{Graphics/HomoSEP.png} \\
    
    Fig 1.3: Solinas HomoSEP \\
\end{center}



\section{Challenges}
Existing wastewater treatment practices encounter multifaceted challenges impeding resource recovery from industrial wastewater. 
\vspace{2mm} \\
Complicated procedures result in low quantitative resource recovery, leading to elevated expenditure costs. \\ 

The presence of environmental pollutants in low-quality resources poses risks, and occupational health impacts on wastewater treatment plant personnel arise from exposure to hazardous compositions and secondary pollutants during processing. 
\vspace{2mm} \\
Presently, wastewater treatment processes are characterized by machinery with substantial power consumption, resulting in a considerable carbon footprint that adversely affects the environment. Moreover, a majority of these apparatus exhibit a notable mass, necessitating the use of heavy machinery for both operation and transportation. This highlights a need for the development of wastewater treatment mechanisms that can address the dual challenges of efficient transportability and environmental sustainability. \\

\section{Goals}
Our objective is to develop an innovative mechanical product design of an agitator that will be dedicated to the task of homogenizing solid material or waste with liquid substances like water or wastewater and aligns with the organization's commitment to sustainability in the realm of water contamination and problems related to manual scavenging. 
\vspace{2mm} \\
Given the specified dimensions of the tank, our task involves constructing an agitator featuring a retractable and extendable shaft with a minimum length of 1 meter and a maximum length of 5 meters, with the overarching objective of achieving a balance between robustness and lightweight construction, ideally not exceeding 40 kilograms to withstand the forces exerted by the dense slurry water. To ascertain its strength, we plan to conduct simulations using software tools such as \textbf{Fusion 360}, \textbf{SolidWorks}, and \textbf{ANSYS}. 
\vspace{2mm} \\
In our pursuit of creating a portable agitator, we aim to employ the most suitable materials and design an outer structure that maximizes space efficiency. Simultaneously, we are committed to ensuring user-friendly operation by incorporating a single-button control mechanism for both retraction and contraction. Safety and reliability are paramount considerations in our design, necessitating features such as corrosion due to toxic chemicals in wastewater. Additionally, we plan to integrate bearings and seals into the system to prevent the infiltration of fluids, thereby enhancing the overall integrity of the agitator.

\chapter{Design}
\section{Design Objectives}
\textbf{Depth Capability} is required to build an agitator shaft with a length of 1 meter, engineered to possess the capability of extending up to 5 meters to meet the specific design requirements. To meet the \textbf{flexibility} criteria, the shaft must demonstrate both strength and flexibility to endure substantial forces and torques that will impact it during agitation in a septic tank of the given size. It is ensured that the shaft would withstand the forces and torques by carrying out simulations on software like Fusion 360, SolidWorks, and Ansys. To minimize power loss and enhance the overall portability of the system, we had to devise a design strategy that prioritizes \textbf{lightweight} construction while simultaneously ensuring the maintenance of strength, thereby striking a balance between efficiency and structural integrity. We had aimed to build the machinery such that it weighs less than 40 kilograms and is highly space-efficient without compromising on strength. 
\vspace{2mm} \\
To bring \textbf{Controllability} to the system, it is crucial to establish a controlling mechanism that is not only easily manageable but also ensures precision and reliability. This is essential to guarantee that the required length can be attained consistently and with utmost accuracy throughout the operation of the system with the help of only a single button for both the retraction and extraction process. It is paramount to implement a comprehensive \textbf{safety} protocol throughout the entire system to guarantee that the design is not only practical but also aligns with the organizational requirements, thereby ensuring its usability and suitability for the intended purposes within the organization. Additionally, the design should be \textbf{cost-effective} to the extent that it renders it financially accessible for deployment in rural areas, thereby facilitating its practical utilization in such regions. The design must exhibit a sturdy \textbf{resistance to potential damage} caused by the presence of toxic chemicals present in the wastewater within the tank. This resilience is essential to ensure that the system can endure and operate effectively over an extended period, thereby necessitating minimal maintenance efforts.

\subsection*{Design Table}

The \textbf{Analytic Hierarchy Process} (AHP) is a decision-making methodology that systematically evaluates and prioritizes multiple criteria in complex situations. It employs a hierarchical structure to break down a problem into manageable components. Decision-makers assign pairwise comparisons and relative importance to each criterion, generating a matrix. Through mathematical computations, AHP calculates weighted priorities, facilitating the selection of the most favorable alternative. This method enhances decision-making by providing a structured approach to quantify and compare subjective judgments, fostering a more rational and informed decision process across diverse criteria.

\section{Concept Selection}
Following an extensive research phase and collaborative brainstorming sessions focused on diverse designs for the extendable shaft, we generated a range of alternatives. Subsequently, we meticulously evaluated each design against multiple criteria, ultimately selecting the one that demonstrated superior performance across all relevant factors for optimal functionality as an agitator.

\subsection{Pulley-Cable Transmission with Telescopic Design}
As the rope is tugged, the pulley turns. The force on the rope travels around the pulley to the other end of the rope, so the pulley changes the direction of the force.\cite{pulley_cable} \\     
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=5cm]{Graphics/Pulley_Mechanism.jpg} \\
    \normalsize{Fig 2.2: Pulley cable mechanism enables controlled linear motion in telescopic cylinders}
\end{center}
The telescopic shaft comprises an outer part in the form of a sleeve and an inner part in the form of a shaft portion. The inner part adjustably enters a bore of the outer part in the direction of the common longitudinal axis of both parts. To extend the impeller by 5 meters from its initial height of 1 meter, any telescopic design necessitates the incorporation of a \textbf{minimum of six stages} to facilitate a seamless and effective extension. 
\vspace{2mm} \\
Incorporating this design mandates the installation of a pulley and cable system positioned atop the inner rim of each cylinder. It's important to note that this addition will lead to an enlargement of the overall dimensions of the cylinders, resulting in a design characterized by increased \textbf{bulkiness}. An alternative approach involves reducing the thickness of the cylinders, consequently diminishing the strength of the entire structure. To induce rotation in the impeller, we have the option of either situating the motor above ground and rotating the entire mechanism or lowering both the motor and the mechanism. In this case, due to the bulky design, it is neither feasible to rotate the whole system nor it is safe to descend the motor below the ground into the tank of wastewater\footnote{A \textbf{flexible shaft}, often referred to as a flex shaft, is a device for transmitting rotary motion between two objects that are not fixed relative to one another. It consists of a rotating wire rope or coil which is flexible but has some torsional stiffness. There is a specific minimum bending radius at which the flexible shaft can be coiled.\cite{min_bend} That is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item At 3 mm diameter: 80 mm minimum bending radius
    \item At 5 mm diameter: 150 mm minimum bending radius
    \item At 7 mm diameter: 210 mm minimum bending radius
    \item At 10 mm diameter: 300 mm minimum bending radius
    \item At 15 mm diameter: 450 mm minimum bending radius
\end{itemize}}.
\vspace{2mm} \\

In the utilization of the pulley-cable mechanism, the expansion of the shaft relies on gravity, while its retraction is achieved through the coordinated operation of the pulley and motor. The primary vertical forces consistently acting on the cylinders include the \textbf{downward-acting gravitational force, upward-acting buoyant force, and upward-acting tension} in the string. \\

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=14cm]{Graphics/Buoyancy_Graph.png} \\
    \normalsize{Fig 2.3: Point of Intersection (0.154, 0.03)}
\end{center}
\par Gravitational Force acting on a Hollow Cylindrical Shaft = $F_1$ 
\par Buoyant Force acting on the Shaft = $F_2$
\par Density of Material = $8000 kg/m^3$

\begin{equation*}
    \begin{split} 
        F_1 &= \pi*((r+t)*(r+t)-r*r)*5*8000 N \\
        F_2 &= \pi*(r+t)*(r+t)*5*1400 N \\
    \end{split}
\end{equation*}
\begin{tabular}{r l}
where &r is the inner radius of the shaft in meters \\
&t is the thickness of the cylinder in meters \\
\end{tabular}
% \begin{multicols}{2}
\par Assuming a cylinder of thickness $3 mm$, the average radius of the shaft should have to be $15.4 cm$ and the cylinder will weigh 1272 Newtons, only for the gravitational force to balance out the net buoyant force. Hence, it is clear that it is not feasible to rely on gravitational force for expanding the shaft. The cumulative buoyant force acting on the cylinders will exceed the weight of the cylinders, thereby constraining the telescopic mechanism from expanding to its ultimate length of 5 meters.

\subsection{Pneumatic Telescope}
A pneumatic telescopic cylinder is a type of cylinder that has a compact retracted length but can provide a long output travel. Telescopic cylinders are available in single and double-acting modes. \\
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=6cm]{Graphics/Pneumatic_Telescope.png} \\
    \normalsize{Fig 2.4: Pneumatic telescopic mechanism for linear extension of shaft}
\end{center}
A pneumatic cylinder is a metal cylinder that converts compressed air into linear motion. The air enters the cylinder through a cap and presses on a piston that is attached to another cylinder. There are multiple cylinders packed inside one another this way that expands the shaft.\cite{pneumatic} The benefit of this actuator compared to the hydraulic type was its simple construction that minimize the production cost of material construction and maintenance while at the same time reducing the overall length of the pneumatic cylinder when retracted and maximizing the effective length when extended. 
\vspace{2mm} \\
\textbf{CFM} stands for Cubic Feet per Minute. It's a measure of the amount of air that a compressor can produce at a given pressure level. CFM is an important indicator of performance. The more CFM air compressor is capable of, the greater its output.\cite{numerical_pneumatic} \\
\begin{center}
    % \includegraphics[width=6cm]{Graphics/Pneumatic_Valve.png} \\
    % \normalsize{Fig: Pneumatic Valve}
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
        CFM &= (A*S*C)/1728 \\
        &= (\pi*2*2*196.85*1)/1728 \\
        &= 1.43 m^3/s \\
        V &= CFM*1.5 \\
        &= 1.43*1.5 gal \\
        &= 2.15 gal = 8138 cm^3 \\
    \end{split}
\end{equation*}
\begin{tabular}{c c l} 
where &A &= Piston Area ($inch^2$) \\
&S &= Stroke ($inch$) \\
&C &= Cycles per minute \\
&V &= Volume of the Pneumatic Tank Required
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\par This refers to the dimensions of the cylinder intended for above-ground placement in the pneumatic mechanism, and its considerable size diminishes the overall portability of the system.\cite{pneumatic_size_1,pneumatic_size_2} The actual control model consists of a multi-order Proportional-Integral (PI) that will control the error in displacement, velocity, and acceleration of the cylinder motion, making it difficult to implement. This will make manipulation of the length of the shaft to a certain value very difficult.

\subsection{Hydraulic Telescopic Mast}
A hydraulic telescopic cylinder is a single-acting cylinder that can push outwards using hydraulic pressure. It's made up of two or more nested tubes, called stages, that decrease in diameter from the outer barrel. The mechanism operates using hydraulic fluid, typically oil, which is stored in a reservoir. A hydraulic pump pressurizes the fluid and sends it through hydraulic lines to the telescopic cylinder.\cite{hydraulic}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=12cm]{Graphics/Hydraulic_Telescope.png} \\
    Fig 2.5: Working of a Hydraulic Cylinder \\
\end{center}
Hydraulic telescopic cylinders are more \textbf{complex} than single-stage cylinders. The presence of multiple stages and components increases the chances of wear and tear. Maintenance can be more intricate and may require specialized knowledge. The use of multiple seals and joints in a telescopic cylinder increases the risk of \textbf{hydraulic fluid leakage}. This can lead to environmental concerns, reduced efficiency, and the need for more frequent maintenance. 
\vspace{2mm} \\
Telescopic cylinders are sensitive to side loads, which can occur if the load is not evenly distributed or if there is misalignment. Side loading can lead to increased wear, reduced efficiency, and potential damage to the cylinder. Also, as the number of stages increases, the load capacity of a telescopic cylinder may decrease when fully extended. This is due to the reduction in the effective piston area at each stage. It's important to consider load capacity limitations at different extension lengths. Telescopic cylinders may experience more vibration and oscillation, especially at extended lengths. This can affect the stability and performance of the equipment, particularly in operations where precision is crucial.

\subsection{Scissor Lift Mechanism}
The scissor mechanism can also be used to get an extension and retraction ratio of \textbf{5:1}. This structure can compress or extend like an accordion inspired by the scissor jack used to lift cars, forming a characteristic rhomboidal pattern. A scissor mechanism operates on the principle of a set of linked, folding supports arranged in a crisscross "X" pattern. When the supports are extended, the impeller descends vertically.\cite{scissor_jack_1} We can control the scissor mechanism by using a \textbf{hydraulic piston} or \textbf{lead screw}. The greater the number of scissors employed in the mechanism, the greater the force needed for both expansion and contraction. To reduce the number of scissors, it is necessary to increase the maximum angle that each scissor achieves in the expanded position. 
\vspace{2mm} \\
If the maximum angle of the scissors is elevated or the quantity of scissors within the chain is substantial, it will result in weakened structural integrity. To maintain the strength of the structure, the maximum angle must be around \textbf{45 degrees}. By the physical limitations of the model, the scissors can achieve a minimum 8\degree angle. As the tank has a diameter of $40 cm$, the horizontal length of the scissor must be less than $40 cm$ at all times.\cite{scissor_jack_2} Considering, the length of each scissor (l) to be $33 cm$:\\ 

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=7cm]{Graphics/Scissor_Retracted_Out.png}
    \includegraphics[width=7cm]{Graphics/Scissor_Retracted_In.png} \\
    \normalsize{Fig 2.6: Scissor structure at maximum possible contraction; minimum length} \\
    \vspace{0.4cm}
    \includegraphics[width=7cm]{Graphics/Scissor_Expanded_Out.png}
    \includegraphics[width=7cm]{Graphics/Scissor_Expanded_In.png} \\
    \normalsize{Fig 2.7: Scissor structure at maximum possible extension; maximum length } \\
    \vspace{0.8cm}
    \begin{tabular}{r l}
    Number of scissors (n) &= 19 \\
    Retracted Height &= $n*l*sin(\theta_min)$ \\
    &$= 19*0.33*sin(8.17\degree)$ \\
    &$= 0.89 m$ \\
    Expanded Height &= $n*l*sin(\theta_max)$ \\
    &$= 19*0.33*sin(54\degree)$ \\
    &$= 5.07 m$
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

A challenge analogous to the pulley-cable system arises in the scissor mechanism, where rotating the entire structure is not feasible owing to its intricate design.

\subsection{Lead Screw Telescopic Mast}
A lead screw is a type of screw that is used as a linear actuator to \textbf{translate rotational motion into linear motion}. It typically consists of a screw (threaded rod) and a nut. The screw has a helical thread, and the nut has corresponding threads that match the screw. When the screw is rotated, the nut moves linearly along the threads, causing linear motion. The lead-screw telescopic mechanism is a system that facilitates the extension and retraction of a shaft through the utilization of a \textbf{lead screw}, causing telescopic cylinders to undergo linear motion relative to each other. This mechanism is characterized by interconnecting various stages of the telescope, with each stage being linked to another through \textbf{threaded connections}. Notably, the inner cylinders are equipped with threads on their outer surfaces, while the outer cylinders feature threads on their inner surfaces.\cite{lead_screw}
\vspace{2mm} \\

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=10cm]{Graphics/Lead_Screw_Expanded.png} \\
    \includegraphics[width=10cm]{Graphics/Lead_Screw_Retracted.png} \\
    \normalsize{Fig 2.8: Rotation of Screw at the Appex markets the system expand or contract}
\end{center}
Upon assembly, the cylinders are configured in a manner that enables the rotation of one inner cylinder to induce a movement in the connected outer cylinders through the threaded connections. Consequently, as one inner cylinder rotates, the outer cylinders associated with it move away, driven by the threading mechanism. The subsequent inner cylinder, which is in contact with the outer cylinder, propels it along a linear groove, resulting in the rotation of both the inner and outer cylinders in tandem. This intricate system, comprised of \textbf{multiple interconnected cylinders}, operates cohesively to facilitate the extension of the shaft. The number of stages of cylinders utilized in the design dictates the extent to which the shaft will extend, making the lead-screw telescopic mechanism a \textbf{versatile} and adjustable engineering solution. 
\vspace{2mm} \\
The depth capability exhibited by this particular design is noteworthy, primarily since the extent of shaft extension is solely contingent upon the number of cylindrical stages incorporated into the system. It is noteworthy to emphasize that the retracted length of the shaft remains entirely independent of the number of stages employed in the system, thereby underscoring the design's inherent versatility and consistent performance across various configurations. The simplicity of this design is noteworthy, allowing for an extension of any number of stages, limited only by the permissible size constraints. Furthermore, its \textbf{lightweight} nature is a distinct advantage, given that it doesn't necessitate the incorporation of additional external components for the extension mechanism. This inherent simplicity and adaptability contribute to the versatility and ease of implementation of the design across a range of applications. Operating based on a singular rotating screw, this mechanism facilitates the seamless expansion or retraction of the entire system, thereby ensuring a \textbf{user-friendly} and straightforward operation. It reaches great depths effortlessly and reliably. 
\vspace{2mm} \\
The ease of rendering this design both \textbf{waterproof} and \textbf{sparkproof} is notable, as it obviates the need for the motor or any electronic component to be immersed in the slurry. The design's inherent resistance to sparks is predominantly ensured by the careful selection of materials for the shaft, while the incorporation of seals, such as the \textbf{wiper seal}, serves to fortify its waterproof properties, safeguarding against the intrusion of water and thereby enhancing its overall resilience and safety features.

The self-repairing nature of the oxide layer aids in mitigating damage. Stainless steel's versatility extends to various grades tailored for specific applications, making it a preferred material in industries where corrosion resistance is paramount, from construction to medical devices. Regular maintenance ensures its prolonged effectiveness in challenging environments. 
\vspace{2mm} \\
Austenitic stainless steel grades, such as 304 and 316, are known for their excellent resistance to chloride-induced corrosion, making them widely used in applications where exposure to saltwater or chloride-containing solutions is a concern. Also, it is resistant to corrosion from phenols, especially at ambient temperatures.

\end{center}
To ensure that no fluid enters inside the shaft mechanism, a \textbf{wiper seal} is strategically positioned in piston assemblies to exclude contaminants, remove debris, and contribute to the overall air-tight sealing of the cylinder. A wiper seal made up of high-performance\textbf{ polyurethanes }is a specialized sealing component designed to prevent the ingress of contaminants. High-performance polyurethanes are chosen for their exceptional durability, wear resistance, and resilience in demanding operating conditions. Its design and functionality play a pivotal role in protecting the cylinders and ensuring the long-term performance of the telescopic system.\cite{wiper_seal} The wiper seal typically features a lip or scraper edge that is in contact with the moving rod or shaft of a hydraulic or pneumatic cylinder. As the rod moves in and out, the wiper seal scrapes away and wipes off any debris or contaminants that may adhere to the rod's surface. This action is crucial in maintaining the integrity of the internal seals and preventing damage to the cylinder components.\cite{wiper_seal_material}
